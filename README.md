# Octopus scripts

A collection of scripts to postprocess data generated from Octopus (www.octopus-code.org), an highly scalable rea-space real-time TDDFT code.


## bands2h.py
This utility converts the bands structure file generated by Octopus into a human-readable and easy-to-plot format. The script is capable to handle 1D, 2D and 3D data and perform cuts interpolating the band-structure on arbitrary segmented-lines in the Brillouin zone. 

####Usage
Cut the band structure contained in ```file``` along the segment connecting (0,0,0) and (0,0,1/2) in reduced coordinates:  
```bands2h.py -r -c "0,0,0; 0,0,1/2" file```  

To generate the complete band structure from 2D data:
```bands2h.py file```
